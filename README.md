# Automated Laundromat System

**Software Engineering SDLC project covering requirements (FRs & NFRs), design and analysis (UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Domain Model, Sequence), full-stack implementation (Flutter frontend + Firebase database and hosting), testing (plans & cases), and deployment of a smart laundromat web system.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Automated Laundromat System** is a web-based application that automates common laundromat operations while demonstrating a complete **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** from requirements to deployment.

**User roles:**
- **Visitor:** one-time user who can browse and book machines.
- **Client:** registered user with booking history and reward points.
- **Admin:** manages machines, monitors usage & revenue, and responds to client feedback.

**Key capabilities**   
- Registration & login for clients; visitor can book as guest.
- Machine **booking & scheduling** (up to two consecutive cycles).
- **Online card** and **on-site coin** payment options.
- **Reward points** program for frequent clients.
- **Feedback module** with separate client and admin responses.
- **Admin dashboard** for revenue reports and machine monitoring.
- Real-time data storage and updates via **Firebase Realtime Database**.
- **Deployed prototype** for demonstration using **Firebase Hosting**.

---

## 📋 Requirements
The project began with eliciting and documenting:
- **Functional requirements:**  
  booking and cancellation of machines, payments, reward accumulation, client feedback, admin response, etc.  
- **Non-functional requirements:**  
  system reliability, responsiveness, scalability, maintainability, and basic security constraints.
- Defined **system scope, primary actors, and constraints**.

(Full details are available in `docs/Final_Project_Report.pdf`.)

## 🏗️ Design & Analysis
A set of **UML artifacts** was produced to move from requirements to system design:
- **Use Case Diagram** – shows how Visitor, Client, and Admin interact with the system.
- **Domain Model Diagram** – conceptual view of laundromat entities (User, Machine, Booking, Payment, Reward, Feedback).
- **Class Diagram** – planned software-level structure of classes, attributes, and methods  
  *(design reference — final Flutter widget structure differs, as is common in web/mobile apps)*.
- **Sequence Diagrams** – depict runtime interaction flows for key scenarios (Booking, Payment, Scheduling).

_All diagrams are in `docs/diagrams/`._

## 💻 Full-Stack Implementation
- **Frontend:**  
  Built entirely in **Flutter Web** for a responsive interface.  
  Main modules/pages:
  - Visitor and Client: Login & Registration, Booking Page, Payment Page, Feedback Page, User Dashboard  
  - Admin: Feedback Management

- **Backend / Database:**  
  Implemented using **Firebase Realtime Database**.  
  Designed and maintained structured nodes for Users, Machines, Bookings, Payments, Rewards, and Feedback.  
  Application logic updates database entries in real-time on booking, payment confirmation, feedback submission, and admin responses.

- **Deployment:**  
  Web app deployed using **Firebase Hosting** for live demonstration.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Designed a comprehensive **Testing Plan** and prepared **Test Cases** covering:
  - User registration / login flow
  - Machine booking & cancellation
  - Payment processing
  - Reward points calculation
  - Feedback submission and admin responses
  - Data update checks in the database
- Executed test cases and documented outcomes (see `docs/testing_plan.md` & `docs/testing_results.md`).

---

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions
- Served as **Team Lead** – coordinated weekly deliverables and managed milestone tracking.
- **Implemented the entire web application frontend** (all pages listed above).
- **Designed and integrated the Firebase Realtime Database** including booking/payment/reward/feedback logic.
- Set up **Firebase Hosting deployment**.
- Led **requirements documentation** (FRs & NFRs) and **UML design** (Use Case, Domain Model, Class, Sequence).
- Authored and executed **testing plans and cases**.
- Co-authored the **41-page final project report**.
